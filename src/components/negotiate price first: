negotiate price first:

We ask for 6 if purchasing 500.

here is the offer we recieved from your competitor:
$6.25, what would you be able to offer if we made a large
purchase of 500 hats?

*Ask Why if they say no*


then negotiate  LEad-Time ( deilvery Time )
 We can do blah if you can lower the delievery Time ( Lead Time )


 Ok, no problem. We take our busines very seriously. meaning 
 quality is very important to us and our customers.

We're looking at your company and other companies with similar
quality, so i don't know if we can trust and buy a lot of products
from you without error.


We would really like to cooperate with you and your company. So, we would 
like to made a TEST-ORDER of 50 hats to test the quality of your products. 
After We inspect the hats, we will move forward and make bigger purchases.

Is that something you and your company will be ok with?
